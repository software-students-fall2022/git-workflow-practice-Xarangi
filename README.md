## Impact and Software Engineering

The following paragraphs will discuss and reference this [article](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/software-engineering/)

### General
Software Engineering is well known to be a relatively lucrative career path in today's landscape. The flexibility of the role also opens up a softare engineer's path to work in a field they are passionate in having an impact about, at least in some capacity. Together with the highly specialized skill sets SWEs tend to have, this means that this role is really good if one wants to have an impact through their career.

### In AI Safety
Another underexplored pathway for software engineers interested in having an impact is to work as an engineer in an AI Safety focused organization.  Software engineers help optimize and secure the procedures at an AI safety organization and generally do not require prior ML experience. Their role includes building interfaces to better run AI safety experiments and working on other pipelines to effectively run the experiments. It is different from that of an ML engineer as it does not involve directly implementing ML algorithms, or working on implementing research projects. This role might lead to opportunities to work with ML in the future, if one is interested in doing so

><b>Comment</b> <i>By Maaz Ahmed</i> <br> The article's discussion of using a career in software engineering as a tool to increase one's impact on the world is highly interesting. The site seems to offer further resources to explore the same, and I hope to look into it when I have time. I would also recommend reading it for others interested in the field!
